<h1>Practical Part 4</h1>
<p>In the final part of the practical assessment you are to design and build a user interface that meets the following requirements:</p>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>a &quot;course application&quot; screen or similar that is asking an applicant to double check and confirm their details.</p>
<p>The screen needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows user data including:
<ul>
<li>First, middle and last name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone and cell phone</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Nationality</li>
<li>Primary <em>and</em> secondary next of kin details
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone and cell</li>
<li>email</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avatar image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allows user to edit any field in order to correct the data</li>
<li>Asks user to accept a &quot;true and accurate&quot; type of statement</li>
<li>Click button to confirm details are correct</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole point is that there is a lot of data to display so you will need to think carefully about the best way to do it while allowing editing as well. Think outside the box!</p>
<p>Of course you are not just making a boring old desktop UI. It also needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be responsive</li>
<li>Be accessible</li>
<li>Be maintainable</li>
<li>Be secure</li>
<li>Follow UX best practices</li>
</ul>
<h2>But where will the data come from??</h2>
<p>Use a free API like <a href="https://randomuser.me/documentation">RandomUser</a>. You can pull in multiple people to meet the Next of Kin requirements.</p>
<p>Note: you will probably be able to repurpose a bit this code in your final project.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><em>What happens after the data is submitted?</em><br>
Nothing, there's no need to save it for this excercise. After the whole workflow is finished just return the user to the beginning.</p>
<p><em>Can I use a different API?</em><br>
I guess so, as long as it meets the requirements.</p>
<p><em>Do I have to use Eleventy? Or SASS? Or some other technology?</em><br>
Well, your code should meet best practices and be maintainable and scalable. It's kind of a &quot;use your judgement&quot; situation, but imagine if this needed to be expanded one day into a giant course application system or similar with menus and sidebars and bells and whistles.</p>
<h2>How do I submit it?</h2>
<p>Turns out that GitHub classroom has a mechanism for this already: you should commit all your changes to master and when you're finished just accept the pull request into the feedback branch. GitHub Classroom made it for us already!</p>
